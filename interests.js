/*Computer programming is one of the few things in life where you start from scratch,
and come up with something very powerful. You not only have fun while programming to make something,
but you also can accomplish a lot of things depending on what you want to achieve.
My perspective of programming is that you can create software that everybody could benefit from. I believe
programming can not only make programmers great but the software can make all of our lives better as they have
done and still are now. If what I create could help somebody else, I'd have accomplished all.
